# Season 1's Retro Distribution of $RAID

### Request Submitted By

arentweall (amos) on behalf of Season 1 cohort

## Summary

This is a retro distribution request for all Raid Guild Season 1 cohort members, who were not included in the initial distribution. 

After verifying with AaronS, we will benchmark the request per member to the minimum amount of 20,461.73 RAID (rounded down to 20,461). Since we have 38 members, this gives us a total of 20,461 * 38 = 777,518 $RAID.

777,518 $RAID will be sent to the Season 1 DAO's Treasury address (0x10e31c10fb4912bc408ce6c585074bd8693f2158), where each member claims their respective shares via a Funding Proposal.
